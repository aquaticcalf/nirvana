i am currently working on my own little operating system

and if u are interested in os development too,

check out these resources, which i found to be useful to me:

- [osdev.org wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page) -> beautiful resource if you've ever wanted to delve into operating systems
- [minix](http://www.minix3.org/) -> this is what motivated to make my own os
- [a heavily commented linux kernel source code (pdf) ](http://www.oldlinux.org/download/ECLK-5.0-WithCover.pdf)
- [nachos](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~tom/nachos/)
- [operating systems - three easy pieces (book)](https://www.amazon.com/Operating-Systems-Three-Easy-Pieces/dp/198508659X/)
- and [r/osdev](https://www.reddit.com/r/osdev/) ofc
